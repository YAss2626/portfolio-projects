# portfolio-projects
Collection of my academic and personal projects in computer science.

This repository showcases a variety of projects, demonstrating my expertise across different programming languages, algorithms, and technologies. It includes:

KNN Java: A highly optimized implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification tasks. This project leverages object-oriented principles and provides a robust solution for data analysis.

Python Card Game x2: Two different implementations of popular games (le Pouilleux / XOXO), developed in Python, showcasing my understanding of object-oriented programming, game logic, and GUI design.

Bohanza Card Game C++: A C++ implementation of the popular Bohanza card game. This project emphasizes efficient data structures, game mechanics, and dynamic memory management in C++.

e-Hotels Website (PHP & SQL): A full-fledged web application designed for hotel booking management, using PHP for backend development and SQL for database integration. This project demonstrates my proficiency in web development, database management, and API integration.
